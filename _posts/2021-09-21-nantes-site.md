We are proud to announce the arrival of a new IoT-LAB site located in the city of Nantes (Pays de la Loire).

More precisely the nodes are deployed at the IETR laboratory of the Polytech’Nantes engineering school, in collaboration with the LS2N Laboratory.
You can find information about the actual deployment by following this [link](https://www.iot-lab.info/docs/deployment/nantes/). More development will arrive soon.

We warmly thank the people who worked on this project and in particular Sébastien Pillement, Marc Brunet and Amine Benomar from the University of Nantes.
